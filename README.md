Netflix Search App

A simple Python application that allows users to search for Netflix titles using a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI). This app leverages the power of `pandas` to load and search through a CSV dataset of Netflix titles.

## Features

- **Search by Title**: Enter a movie or show title to find matches.
- **View Results**: Displays title, type, genre, and release year of the matched entries.
- **Error Handling**: Provides error messages if the dataset cannot be loaded or if there are issues with the search.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Netflix-Search-App.git
   cd Netflix-Search-App
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Install `pandas` if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   Ensure you have the `netflix_titles.csv` dataset. Place it in the same directory as `app.py` or update the file path in the script accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Search for Titles**:
   - Enter a search query in the text box and click "Search."
   - Results will be displayed below the search button.
